PowerShell scripting is a way to automate tasks on Windows computers using a language called PowerShell. It lets you write scripts, which are like lists of instructions for the computer to follow. These scripts can help you do things like manage files, configure settings, and perform system tasks without having to click around manually. PowerShell scripts use small commands called cmdlets, which you can combine to perform more complex tasks. This makes it easier for IT professionals to handle repetitive jobs quickly and efficiently.
